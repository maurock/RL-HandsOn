# Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On

This repository is a collection of algorithms from the book "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On" by Maxim Lapan (2nd edition).
My implementations are based on the theoretical explanation of the algorithms and not on the author's implementation.

This repository uses PyTorch as main DL library and the methods are mostly tested on OpenAI scenarios.
